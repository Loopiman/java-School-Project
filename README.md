# Java School Project
For my second year as a bachelor, we had to make a Java project in a console app. The Idea was to be able to make a project using relational object with de JDBC driver to connect with a database.

We didn't used any framework, the idea here was to understand manually how things work.

## About the project
The project is a lessons school management. It means that we can register a new teacher, asign him to a course with a class in a specific room.
